# Sentimental-analysis

A standard deep learning model for text classification and sentiment analysis uses a word embedding layer and 
one-dimensional convolutional neural network.The model can be expanded by using multiple parallel convolutional 
neural networks that read the source document using different kernel sizes. This, in effect, creates a multichannel 
convolutional neural network for text that reads text with different n-gram sizes (groups of words).

In this notebook, you will discover how to develop a multichannel convolutional neural network for 
sentiment prediction on text movie review data.
